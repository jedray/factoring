## Synopsis

This project provides the implementation of several factoring algorithms in C++.

## Motivation

This project was started as an assignment for the [DD2440 Advanced Algorithms](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DD2440?l=en) course at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](kth.se). 


## Test

To run the code, first set the value of variable `ALGORITHM` in line 36 to the desired factoring algorithm. 
Next, compile it writing typing 

	make


Finally run it and test some sample data.

	./factor < samples/factoring.in


If you want to test it on specific numbers, you can simply run

	python -c "pring NUMBER" | ./factor

where NUMBER is the number to test.

If you want know the running time, replace `./factor` by `./factor 1`.
